django-durationfield
====================

A reusable application for a DurationField in Django.

This reusable app was conceived as a temporary solution for an old request to add
native support for an interval or duration field to Django core, 
`#2443 <http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/2443>`_,
"Add IntervalField to database models." This app started from the 
2010-01-25 patch by Adys (Jerome Leclanche),
`DurationField.patch <http://code.djangoproject.com/attachment/ticket/2443/durationfield.patch>`_ and has evolved considerably as people have used it in their 
own applications.


There have been discussions as to the merit of including into a DurationField
in Django core.  As of the moment, it appears that most developers favor
keeping DurationField separate from Django (both to prevent bloat and to allow
rapid evolution of the DurationField's implementation).

That being said, we have developed the DurationField so that if it ever does
get merged into Django core, it should be simple for users to switch.

This is beta software, please test thoroughly before putting into production
and report back any issues.


Django Versions
---------------

django-durationfield supports Django 1.4.21, and Django 1.6.11
through Django 1.8+, with the goal to
target the currently support versions of Django releases in the future. So as
the Django Project drops support for older versions, django-durationfield will
do the same.

Django 1.4.2 is a minimum version as it introduced `compatibility features
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/python3/>`_ for
supporting both Python 2 and Python 3.

django-durationfield has support for Python 3.4.

Please report any bugs or patches in improve version support.

Usage
-----

In models.py::

    from durationfield.db.models.fields.duration import DurationField

    class Time(models.Model):
        ...
        duration = DurationField()
        ...

In your forms::

    from durationfield.forms import DurationField as FDurationField
    
    class MyForm(forms.ModelForm):
        duration = FDurationField()

Note that database queries still need to treat the values as integers. If you are using things like 
aggregates, you will need to explicitly convert them to timedeltas yourself::

    timedelta(microseconds=list.aggregate(sum=Sum('duration'))['sum'])

Example
-------

Enter the time into the textbox in the following format::

    3 days 2:20:10

or::
    
    3d 2:20:10

This is interpreted as::
    
    3 days 2 hours 20 minutes 10 seconds

In your application it will be represented as a python ``datetime.timedelta``::
    
    3 days, 2:20:10

This will be stored into the database as a 'bigint'.

You can be rather more elaborate by using microseconds and weeks (or even months, and years
with a configuration setting)::

    1 year, 2 months, 3 weeks, 4 days, 5:06:07.000008
 
Years and Months
----------------

You will need to set a setting in your ``settings.py`` to allow your users to enter
values for years or months. This causes a loss of precision because the number 
of days in a month is not exact. This has not been extensively tested.

To allow users to enter ``X years`` or ``X months`` add::

    ``DURATIONFIELD_ALLOW_YEARS = True``

or::

    ``DURATIONFIELD_ALLOW_MONTHS = True``

Currently, those fields will be translated into days using either 365 or 30 respectively.

To override this setting, add an entry into your settings named ``DURATIONFIELD_YEARS_TO_DAYS``
or ``DURATIONFIELD_MONTHS_TO_DAYS`` setting a new translation value.

If you are interested in developing django-duration field, you can use
`tox <tox.readthedocs.org>`_ to test django-durationfield across all
current versions of Django::

Changelog
---------

0.5.2

 * Remove deprecation warning in Django 1.8

0.5.1

 * Correctly parse microseconds. Previously, "0.01" would be incorrectly
   interpreted to mean 1 microsecond, instead of 10000 microseconds.
   Thanks to `Troy Grosfield >https://github.com/troygrosfield>`) for
   bug report and patch.

0.5.0

 * Raise a ValidationError when given an invalid time string. Thanks to
   `blueyed <https://github.com/blueyed>`_ for the bug report.

0.4.0

 * Python 3 support.  Drop support for Django < 1.4
